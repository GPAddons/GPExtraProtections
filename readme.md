## GPExtraProtections
Addon for [GriefPrevention](https://github.com/TechFortress/GriefPrevention) that inserts additional entity protections.

## Features
All features are configurable. For more information, see the [default config](https://github.com/GPAddons/GPExtraProtections/blob/master/src/main/resources/config.yml).

### Protect Unarmed Pillagers
Unarmed pillagers (pillagers whose crossbows have broken through use) are not capable of attacking or picking up weapons.
They are often used in iron farms to lure golems, but since they are "hostile" anyone can kill them.
It takes roughly 15 minutes to fire enough shots to break a pillager's crossbow, so each unarmed pillager represents a non-insignificant time investment.

### Protect Nametagged Entities
Players often keep named entities as part of a display.
Since it would be possible to name a hostile creature and create an army of invincible claimed mobs, this feature does not belong in core GP.
